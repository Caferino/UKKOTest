Concerns / To-Do:

- **Sign-in view:**

1. What if the user already exists after pressing "Sign Up"?
2. "Remember Password" logic.
3. Security breaches, things like 'or'1'='1 (SQL Injection Attack).
4. Placeholder text in input fields won't go away after writing.
5. Enhance error displays.
6. "`<div class="logo">`" is not respecting <div class"logo-container"> (/home/caferino/Documents/GitHub/UKKOTest/app/views/users/index.html.erb line:34:39) for some reason. Tried a lot of combinations with px, vw, %... Removed SVG's default size in a text editor aswell. Managed to give it a temporal fix, but it's not going to adapt well to special screen sizes, it keeps overlapping / getting outside its container.
